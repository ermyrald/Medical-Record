# Medical-Record


A contract to store medical records of individuals
This is a test project to see how efficient smart contracts can be used to store files on a DLT
it may have properties like a simple storage solidity program but a bit complex
it will have functions like store name, age, blood group, genotype, medical issues etc.
this is an on going project!!!
